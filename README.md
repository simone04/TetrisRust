# Tetris but it's Rust

This is my first rust program, so it's probably bad.
Mostly playable, there is a bug, it tries to place a the piece just summoned, it's rare 

## Features

The rotation system follows the tetris official guidelines. 
I used Tetr.io as main inspiration

+ Super Rotation System
+ Ghost piece
+ Lock delay
+ DAS, ARR, SDF handling
+ 5 next pieces knowledge 
+ Holdable piece
